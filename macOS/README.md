# Panglong [Shan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shan_people) language Keyboard layout for iOS (Unicode)

### Unofficial custom "panglong keyboard" layout for **iOS**.
---------------------------
I forked this project from [Tasty Imitation Keyboard](https://github.com/archagon/tasty-imitation-keyboard) by archagon, and **modified** several modules to touch and feel like iOS keyboard behavior as possible as, the keyboard laytout is base on [Panglong Keyboard](https://github.com/NoerNova/Panglong_Shan_Keyboard_macOS).
